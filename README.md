Realised i did not do a Read ME for this game.

---

> There were alot of things that i had learnt about java-script , so i though i would put them into practice using this site.

1. The first thing i learned was the get ElementById(). using the DOM to manipulate areas of the html.
      * i could have used queryselector to do a better job i think. Also maybe make the winner sign not cover the hands so much, but i did that so the only option would be to restart the game again using the top button.
2. i have found javascript difficult using the DOM there is so many little thing to add, but i guess that comes with practice.
 
3. Third thing i learned is j.s syntax is alot harder to use then python ..dont get me wrong j.s is powerfull but its harder to write and read. little things like having to declare you vairable before you can assign it to a refrence.
      > on the other hand, I LOVE the fact that you dont need to change the primitive type when compairing values with the == unless you really want to be specific with the ===

4. tried my hardest to not use google when building this so most of the skills are my own.
      * i did use google to find the charset to see if a value is a letter or not :
      `(/[a-zA-Z]/).test(char)`
