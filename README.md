# ROCK, PAPER , SCISSORS

here is the[ link to the live server](https://optimistic-volhard-d68919.netlify.app/)

Realised i did not do a Read ME for this game.

> There were alot of things that i had learnt about java-script , so i though i would put them into practice using this site.

1. The first thing i learned was the get ElementById(). using the DOM to manipulate areas of the html.
      * i could have used queryselector to do a better job i think. Also maybe make the winner sign not cover the hands so much, but i did that so the only option would be to restart the game again using the top button.
2. i have found javascript difficult using the DOM there is so many little thing to add, but i guess that comes with practice.
